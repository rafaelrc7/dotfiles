## Overview

This is the repository of my personal nix flake. It can be used to build
different NixOS systems or to setup a user configuration in non-nixos systems
trough home-manager.

## Goals

My main goal is to make a customisable config that can be easily adapted. For
instance, I always assume that a system can have multiple users that have
different settings. Users may be defined trough home-manager and be added to
both nixos and non-nixos systems with minimal hassle and a lot of liberty.

Systems may also be built using unique or shared modules at will.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rafaelrc7/dotfiles/
cd dotfiles
```

### Host configuration

If building for the first time.

```sh
nixos-rebuild --use-remote-sudo switch --flake .#hostname
```

If rebuilding a system, as it defaults to use the systems hostname.

```sh
nixos-rebuild --use-remote-sudo switch --flake .
```

### Home-Manager configuration

```sh
nix build --impure .#homeConfigurations.username.activationPackage && ./result/activate
```

## Structure

### flake.nix

Here all the buildable hosts and users are defined, using utility functions and
modules.

### Hosts

NixOS systems may be defined at the `hosts/` directory. Inside it, you may
create a folder for said host.

Inside `hosts/hostname` you may define a `default.nix` file with all
expected configurations for a nixos host and any other modules you choose.

### Home-Manager users

Home-Manager users may be defined at the `users` directory. Inside it, you
may create a folder for each user.

Inside `users/username` you may define a `default.nix` file with all
expected home-manager configuration.

### Modules

You may define shared NixOS modules at `modules/nixos`.

### Utils

The `Utils` folders defines various utility functions used by me, mainly,
on the definition of the `flake.nix file`.

#### mkHome

The `mkHome` function creates a flake for a home-manager configuration on a
non-nixos system.

It's parameters are:

- username
- system (defaults to "x86_64")
- homeModules (defaults to empty list)

  List of user nix modules that should be included.

- overlays (defaults to empty list)

  List of overlays to add to user packages.

- nixpkgs (defaults to `inputs.nixpkgs`)

#### mkHost

The `mkHost` function creates a flake for a NixOS system configuration.

It's parameters are:

- hostName
- system (defaults to "x86_64")
- users (defaults to empty list)

  List of attrsets representing existing home-manager configurations that
  should be included on the host.

  The fields of the attrset are:

  - name
  - extraGroups (defaults to empty list)
  - sshKeys (defaults to empty list)

- nixosModules (defaults to empty list)

  List of modules to be added to system configuration.

- nixpkgs (defaults to `inputs.nixpkgs`)
